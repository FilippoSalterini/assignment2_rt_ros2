/*Implement in ROS2, and with the new robot and simulation environment, the same behaviour implemented with the turtlesim.
The robot is already spawned in (2,2), so there is no need to use services here! You just need to develop a ROS2 package with
one node capable of moving the robot around in the simulation environment*/
